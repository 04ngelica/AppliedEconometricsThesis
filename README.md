<h2>Description</h2>
The project allows students to conduct econometric research on a topic of their choosing. Mine explores a re-examined analysis on transportation mobility and its impacts on poverty rates through the lens of travel delays/increased commute times, controlling for key socioeconomic and geographic factors. I use county-level panel data across 5 states in the US and employ an instrumental variable with fixed effects model.
